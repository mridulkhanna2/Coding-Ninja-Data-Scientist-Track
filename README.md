# 🧠 Early Machine Learning Practice – Learning Lab

This repo is a collection of notebooks from my early deep dive into ML, NLP, and data visualization — all created during a structured learning path. |

---

## 🧪 Purpose

This repo is part of my learning history — not for production, but as a window into how I got started. It documents:
- Key concepts I learned from scratch
- Hands-on experiments and failures
- The building blocks that led to more advanced projects

---

## ⚠️ Note

Some notebooks may be incomplete or unoptimized — intentionally left as-is to reflect raw, early progress.
